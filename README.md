# Examples

### Logging abilities 

```cs
CSLogger.Log(Types.Debug, "Debug log");
CSLogger.Log(Types.Info, "Info log");
CSLogger.Log(Types.Warning, "Warning log");
CSLogger.Log(Types.Error, "Error log");
CSLogger.Log(Types.Critical, "Critical log");
```
### Create custom logs
```cs
CSLCustom pattern = new CSLCustom("<BG=DarkBlue><FG=Yellow>{Timestamp} <FG=Red>[CUSTOM] <FG=Gray>: <FG=Green>{Message}");
CSLogger.LogWithCustomProfile(pattern, "Custom log");
```
- Use ``{Timestamp}`` and ``{Message}`` to define where the timestamp and the message goes
- Use the ``<BG=Color>`` and the ``<FG=Color>`` tag to define the log colors
- You can also use the ``<RS>`` Tag to reset the colors
